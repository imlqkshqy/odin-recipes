        <h3>>>Description</h3>
        <p>A burger, in essence, is a versatile and adaptable dish centered around a cooked patty (whether meat or plant-based) served in a bun, with a multitude of customizable toppings and sauces to satisfy diverse palates.</p>
        <h4>>>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Buns</li>
            <li>Patty (potato-based )</li>
            <li>Veggies <em>(tomatoes, Onions, lettuce....)</em></li>
            <li>Burger Sauce/Mayo</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>>>Procedure</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Prepare Veggies: Steam or boil your chosen vegetables (like potatoes, carrots, peas, beans) until fork-tender but not mushy.</li>
  <li>Mash and Combine: Mash the cooked vegetables, then add finely chopped aromatics (onions, garlic, ginger, green chilies) and spices (like cumin, garam masala, turmeric) to the mashed veggies.</li>
  <li>Add Binder: Incorporate breadcrumbs (or alternatives like poha powder, sattu, or roasted chickpea flour) into the mixture to absorb moisture and bind the patty.</li>
  <li>Form Patties: Divide the mixture and flatten it into patties the size of your burger buns.</li>
  <li>Make Batter & Coat: Prepare a slurry (e.g., using gram flour and water) and dip the patties, then coat them evenly with breadcrumbs for a crispy crust.</li>
  <li>Chill Patties: Refrigerate the patties for 10-20 minutes to help them firm up and hold their shape during cooking.</li>
  <li>Prepare Dressing & Toppings: Whisk together ingredients for your burger sauce (e.g., mayonnaise, mustard, lemon juice, spices) and slice fresh toppings like lettuce, tomatoes, and onions.</li>
  <li>Cook Patties: Heat oil in a pan and shallow fry the patties until golden brown and crispy on both sides. Alternatively, bake or air fry them.</li>
  <li>Toast Buns: Slice burger buns in half and toast them lightly on a pan or in the oven.</li>
  <li>Assemble & Serve: Spread dressing on the bun, add lettuce, cooked patty, toppings, and the top bun. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
