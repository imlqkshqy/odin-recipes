        <li>Combine Chole and Gravy: Add the cooked chickpeas and water or cooking liquor to the gravy. Mash some chickpeas for thickness. Simmer for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Finish with garam masala and coriander leaves.</li>
        <li>Prepare Bhature Dough: Mix maida, salt, sugar, baking powder, and yogurt. Knead into a soft, smooth dough using water as needed. Apply oil and rest for 2-3 hours for fermentation.</li>
        <li>Roll Bhature: Divide dough into equal balls. On a greased surface, roll each ball into a circular or oval shape.</li>
        <li>Deep Fry Bhature: Heat oil for deep frying. Carefully drop a rolled bhatura into the hot oil.</li>
